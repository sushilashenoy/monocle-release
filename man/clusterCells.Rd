}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{the CellDataSet upon which to perform this operation}

\item{skip_rho_sigma}{A logic flag to determine whether or not you want to skip the calculation of rho / sigma}

\item{num_clusters}{Number of clusters. The algorithm use 0.5 of the rho as the threshold of rho and the delta 
corresponding to the number_clusters sample with the highest delta as the density peaks and for assigning clusters}

\item{inspect_rho_sigma}{A logical flag to determine whether or not you want to interactively select the rho and sigma for assigning up clusters}

\item{rho_threshold}{The threshold of local density (rho) used to select the density peaks}

\item{delta_threshold}{The threshold of local distance (delta) used to select the density peaks}

\item{peaks}{A numeric vector indicates the index of density peaks used for clustering. This vector should be retrieved from the decision plot with caution. No checking involved.
will automatically calculated based on the top num_cluster product of rho and sigma.}

\item{gaussian}{A logic flag passed to densityClust function in desnityClust package to determine whether or not Gaussian kernel will be used for calculating the local density}

\item{cell_type_hierarchy}{A data structure used for organizing functions that can be used for organizing cells}

\item{frequency_thresh}{When a CellTypeHierarchy is provided, cluster cells will impute cell types in clusters that are composed of at least this much of exactly one cell type.}

\item{enrichment_thresh}{includeDescrip}

\item{clustering_genes}{a vector of feature ids (from the CellDataSet's featureData) used for ordering cells}

\item{method}{method for clustering cells. By default, we use density peak clustering algorithm for clustering. 
The other method is based on DDRTree.}

\item{verbose}{Verbose parameter for DDRTree}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{densityClust}()}}
}
\value{
an updated CellDataSet object, in which phenoData contains values for Cluster for each cell
}
\description{
Unsupervised clustering of cells is a common step in many single-cell expression
workflows. In an experiment containing a mixture of cell types, each cluster might
correspond to a different cell type. This method takes a CellDataSet as input
along with a requested number of clusters, clusters them with an unsupervised 
algorithm, and then returns the CellDataSet with the cluster assignments stored in
the pData table. When number of clusters is set to NULL (num_clusters = NULL), 
the decision plot as introduced in the above citation will be plotted and the 
users are required to click on the decision plot to select the rho and delta 
to determine the number of clusters to cluster.
